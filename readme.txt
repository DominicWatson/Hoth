Hoth aims to help developers better understand exceptions--caught or not--in
their application so you can prioritize resolution. Hoth is a simple but
effective exception content tracking system. 

What does Hoth do?

Hoth sends you an alert when a new, unique exception occurs within your 
application. You only receive these alerts the first time an exception is seen
by Hoth.

Is that all Hoth does?

Nope! It gets better. Hoth also tracks each occurrence so you can quickly 
understand how frequent an exception is within your app. No more hunting 
through log files that repeat messages over, and over.
